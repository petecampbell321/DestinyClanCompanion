## DestinyClanCompanion - Automated Group Scheduling for Destiny 2 Clans

DestinyClanCompanion (DCC) is an app that makes it easier for Destiny 2 clans (generally those with larger numbers) to organise groups for partaking in raids and other endgame activities. Clan members provide their availability which is then used to formulate suggested groups to be presented to the clan members.

Users will also have the option to manually create groups in cases where the suggested groups don't cover the clans needs; be that to accommodate for partially formed groups, last minute availability changes, etc.

The app can also be used to display member status, a way of showing other clan members what you're available to group for. This can be used to let other clan members know that you're available to group up for certain activities at that time, for example; Strikes, Crucible, Grand Master Nightfalls, etc.

Making test changes on iPad.
